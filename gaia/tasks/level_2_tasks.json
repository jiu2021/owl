It features the players of the most recently aired season. I click on the Seasons tab and scroll down to the first season. I find the winner from the first season (based on my list compiled from the en.wikipedia.org site mentioned in step 1) and scroll through the bio information until I see the mention of their birthday. It is usually contained in the last sentence of the bio. I repeat this process until I get to Season 18. It is at this point that CBS starts to omit the full birthdays. For seasons 18 and 19 they include the month and date but omit the year. By Season 20, the birthday is omitted completely. \n4.
