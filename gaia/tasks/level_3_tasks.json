Checked which classes use ice (Frost) and fire abilities, Death Knight (plate), Mage (cloth), Shaman (mail), and Warlock (cloth).\n14. There can only be one other plate class, so it must be Death Knight or Warrior, and one other cloth class, so it must be Mage or Warlock.\n15. Metamorphosis is a Warlock ability in Wrath of the Lich King, so it must be the other cloth class, and the group so far is Paladin, Priest, Warlock, plate DPS, and other DPS, with remaining options of Death Knight (plate), Hunter (mail), Mage (cloth), Shaman (mail), and Warrior (plate).\n16. There cannot be another cloth class, so the remaining options are Death Knight (plate), Hunter (mail), Shaman (mail), and Warrior (plate).\n17. There is a bear attacking the boss and there is no Druid to shapeshift into a bear, so it must be a Hunter's pet, making the group Paladin, Priest, Warlock, Hunter, and plate DPS, with remaining options of Death Knight (plate), Hunter (mail), Mage (cloth), Shaman (mail), and Warrior (plate).\n18. The last class is plate, leaving only Death Knight and Warrior.\n19. Hunters and Warlocks can both cast Fire abilities but cannot cast Frost abilities, so the last DPS must cast ice (Frost) abilities, making the last DPS a Frost Death Knight since Warriors have no Frost abilities.\n20. Order the group alphabetically: Death Knight, Hunter, Paladin, Priest, Warlock.",

Observe that the smaller astronaut in the image is the one reflected in the other's helmet, so the smaller astronaut must be Charles \"Pete\" Conrad.\n5.

Read through Elliot See's Wikipedia article to find that he died in an accident before his first space flight, so he should be excluded, making Ed White's 4d 01h 56m the least amount of time in space.\n11.
