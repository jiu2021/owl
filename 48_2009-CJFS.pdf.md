## Abstract

ÇAKMAK Y.S., GÜLER G.Ö., AKTÜMSEK A. (2010): Trans fatty acid contents in chocolates and chocolate wafers in Turkey. Czech J. Food Sci., 28: 177-184.

Fatty acid compositions and trans fatty acid contents of chocolate and chocolate wafers collected from Turkish markets were determined by GC. Total 62 samples, being all chocolates and chocolate wafers sold in Turkey, were investigated. 35 samples of chocolate which were categorised as milk chocolate, bitter chocolate, chocolate with nuts, chocolate with pistachio, chocolate with almond, other chocolates, and 27 samples of chocolate wafer which were categorised as pure chocolate wafers and chocolate wafers with nuts belonging to 12 different national chocolate brands, were analysed. Generally, C16:0 palmitic acid, C18:0 stearic acid, and C18:1 oleic acid were the major fatty acids in all sam- ples. Trans fatty acid contents in chocolate wafers samples showed a variation between 0.00-7.92%. Trans fatty acids were determined as 0.00-6.23% in chocolate samples. In conclusion, it was shown that trans fatty acids contents in chocolates were relatively lower than those of other countries.

Trans-isomeric fatty acids occur naturally in dairy and other animal fats by biological hydro- genation in the stomach of ruminants, but they originate mainly from the industrial process of catalytic hydrogenation of fats; 80-90% of di- etary trans fatty acids are derived from this lat- ter source, whereas 2-8% are provided by dairy products (KROMER 1976; MOUNTS 1979). Some fatty acids have one or more double bonds in the trans configuration: these are the so-called trans fatty acids (TFAs) (FRITSCHE & STEINHART 1998). TFAs are present in variable amounts in a wide range of foods, including most foods made with partially hydrogenated oils such as baked goods and fried foods, and some margarine products

(SEMMA 2002). TFAs content varies considerably among foods, reflecting, the differences in the fats and oils used in the manufacturing or preparation processes (INNIS et al. 1999).

TFAs increase plasma concentrations of low- density lipoprotein cholesterol and reduce the concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cho- lesterol (ASCHERIO &WILLET 1997). TFAs have adverse effects on blood lipoproteins, and they are therefore expected to raise the risk of coronary heart disease (KATAN 1998). As a result, the net effect of TFAs on the ratio of LDL to HDL choles- terol is approximately double that of the saturated fatty acids. These adverse effects of TFAs have been confirmed by other studies (ZOCK & KATAN

1992; JUDD et al. 1994). In addition, there are concerns about recent suggestions that TFA may affect human fetal growth and infant development (AYAGARI et al. 1996). Also, an association exists between the prevalence of asthma and allergies in children and the risk of diabetes in adults with the intake of trans isomers (WEILAND et al. 1999; STENDER & DYERBERG 2004).

Some research has been carried out into TFAs in various foods worldwide (DEMMELMAIR et al. 1996; WAGNER et al. 2000; MOJSKA et al. 2006) and in Turkey (DEMIRBAS & YILMAZ 2000; CETIN et al. 2003; DAGLIOGLU & TASAN 2003; KARABULUT 2007; BASOL & TASAN 2008). The most recent study concerning trans fatty acids in Turkey reports fatty acid compositions of Turkish shortenings (BASOL & TASAN 2008). The authors stated that partially hydrogenated vegetable oils with a high TFA content were still the major raw materials used in the production of Turkish shortenings. However, there is limited research (KARABULUT 2007) into fatty acids composition and trans fatty acids contents in chocolates. Therefore, the objec- tive of this study is to determine the fatty acids compositions and trans fatty acids contents in all chocolate and chocolate wafers brands sold in Turkish markets.

## MATERIALS AND METHODS

Sample collection. 35 samples of chocolates and 27 samples of chocolate wafers belonging to 12 different national chocolate brands were ana- lysed in 2007. The chocolates were categorised as milk chocolates (n = 13), bitter chocolates (n = 4), chocolates with nuts (n = 8), chocolates with pis- tachio (n = 3), chocolates with almond (n = 2), other chocolates (n = 5), and chocolate wafers were categorised as pure chocolate wafers (n = 14) and chocolate wafers with nuts (n = 13). Total 62 samples were investigated, being all chocolate and chocolate wafers brands sold in Turkey.

Fatty acid analysis. The samples of chocolates and chocolate wafers were extracted using the FOLCH et al. (1957) method. The fatty acids in the total lipid were esterified into methyl esters by saponification with 0.5N methanolic NaOH and transesterified with 14% BF2 (v/v) in methanol (PAQUOT 1979).

Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were analysed on a HP (Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, USA) Agilent

6890N model gas chromatograph (GC), equipped with a flame ionisation detector (FID) and fitted with a HP-88 capillary column (100 m, 0.25 mm i.d. and 0.2 um). The injector and detector tem- peratures were 240°℃ and 250℃, respectively. The oven was programmed at 160℃ initial temperature and 2 min initial time. Thereafter, the temperature increased by 4℃/min to 185℃, then it increased by 1°C/min to 200℃ and was held for 46.75 min at 200°C. Total run time was 70 minutes. Carrier gas was helium (1 ml/min).

The identification of fatty acids was carried out by comparing the sample FAME peak relative retention times with those obtained for Alltech (Carolean Industrial Drive, Satate Collage, USA) standards. The results were expressed as FID re- sponse area relative percentages. Each reported result is the average value of three GC analyses. The results are presented as means + SD.

## RESULTS

Fatty acids compositions and trans fatty acids contents in 35 chocolates (milk chocolates, bit- ter chocolates, chocolates with nuts, chocolates with pistachio, chocolates with almond, and other chocolates) and 27 chocolate wafers (pure chocolate wafers, and chocolate wafers with nuts) belong- ing to 12 different national brands obtained from markets in Turkey are presented in Tables 1 and 2. The TFA content varied depending on the chocolate and chocolate wafers groups (Table 3).

Twenty five fatty acids in chocolates and choco- late wafers lipids were identified and evaluated. Palmitic acid, stearic acid, and oleic acid were high in chocolates and chocolate wafers. Oleic acid was the major fatty acids in all samples except for bitter chocolate (Tables 1 and 2).

Palmitic and stearic acids were the major satu- rated fatty acids (SFA) in chocolates and chocolate wafers. Palmitic and stearic acids ranged between 20.39-25.80% and 25.77-34.66% in chocolate groups, and 24.89-26.52% and 17.86-21.10% in chocolate wafers groups, respectively (Tables 1 and 2). High amounts of lauric acid were deter- mined in pure chocolate wafers (5.11%) and choco- late wafers with nuts (4.08%).

Oleic acid was the major monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) in all samples. Oleic acid was found to amount to 43.33%, 38.49%, 36.88%, 36.39%, 33.80%, 33.16%, 32.99%, and 32.31%, in chocolates

The percentage of oleic acid was found to be 36.246% and 34.932% in chocolates and chocolate wafers groups, respectively (Tables 1 and 2).

Linoleic acid was the primary polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) in all samples. This fatty acid was found to represent 10.28%, 9.00%, 7.69%, 7.45%, 6.95%, 5.82%, 3.89%, and 3.33%, in chocolate wa- fers with nuts, other chocolates, pure chocolate wafers, chocolates with pistachio, chocolates with almond, chocolates with nuts, milk chocolates,

and bitter chocolates groups, respectively. The percentage of linoleic acid found was 6.074% and 8.989% in chocolate and chocolate wafers groups, respectively (Tables 1 and 2).

SFAs contents were found to be higher than those of MUFAs and PUFAs in all samples and were determined to be 61.10%, 60.23%, 56.74%, 56.52%, 53.70%, 51.18%, 49.93%, and 47.77%, in bitter chocolates, milk chocolates, pure chocolate wafers, other chocolates, chocolates with almond, chocolates with pistachio, chocolate wafers with nuts, and chocolates with nuts, respectively. The percentage of SFA was found to be 55.08%, and 53.327% in chocolate and chocolate wafers groups, respectively (Tables 1 and 2).

In our study, the percentages of C 16:1 t9, C 18:1 t9, C 18:2 t9t12, and C 18:2 t9c12 ranged from 0.00% to 0.07%, 0.00% to 0.72%, 0.00% to 0.19%, and 0.00% to 0.05%, in chocolates groups, respectively (Table 1). The percentages of C 16:1 t9, C 18:1 t9, C 18:2 t9t12, and C 18:2 t9c12 ranged from 0.03% to 0.03%, 0.56% to 1.19%, 0.03% to 0.13%, and 0.03% to 0.04%, in chocolate wafers groups, respectively (Table 2). Total trans fatty acids contents were found to be higher in chocolate wafers with nuts than in other samples (1.39%). C 18:1 t9 elaidic acid, was found to be the most abundant trans fatty acid in all samples. TFAs were found in all samples of milk chocolates, pure chocolate wafers, other chocolates, chocolates with pistachio, chocolates with almond, chocolate wafers with nuts and chocolates with nuts but none of the TFAs was determined in bitter chocolates. Minimum and maximum ranges of TFAs were de- termined as 0.00-6.23% in the chocolate samples and 0.00-7.92% in the wafer chocolate samples (Table 3). The percentages of TFAs were determined as 0.407% and 1.019% in chocolates and chocolate wafers groups, respectively (Tables 1 and 2).

## DISCUSSION

TARKOWSKI and KOWALCZYK (2007) investigated the fatty acids contents in milk chocolates mar- keted in Poland. They analysed fourteen chocolate samples. It was observed that palmitic, stearic, oleic, and linoleic acids were the predominant fatty acids. Similarly, in our study, oleic, stearic, palmitic, and linoleic acids were the major fatty acids with proportions of 36.246%, 28.22%, 23.925%, and 6.074%, in chocolate groups, and 34.932%, 19.479%, 25.705%, and 8.989% in chocolate wafers groups,

respectively. TARKOWSKI and KOWALCZYK (2007) also observed that the chocolates supplemented with nuts had higher oleic and linoleic acids con- tents. Similarly, in our study, oleic acid was also found to be contained in the highest proportion in chocolates with nuts (43.33%).

DEMMELMAIR et al. (1996) investigated TFAs contents in 42 different brands of spreads and cold meats including chocolate spreads consumed by German children (4-7 years old). They determined trans fatty acid content in chocolate spreads in the range of 0.7-11.1%. In our study, TFAs content was relatively lower than in their findings. We observed that TFAs content was 0.0-6.23% in chocolates and 0.00-7.92% in chocolate wafers.

WAGNER et al. (2000) investigated the contents of TFAs in margarines, plant oils, fried products, and chocolate spreads in Austria. They observed that the levels of TFAs were 0.6-8.9% (mean 4.9%) in chocolate spreads. They suggested the use of partially hydrogenated fats in the manufacture of these spreads. In our study, we determined that TFAs contents were 0.00-6.23% (mean 0.407%) in chocolates and 0.00-7.92% (mean 1.019%) in chocolate wafers. Thus, TFAs content in chocolates was in Turkey relatively lower than in Austria. WAGNER et al. (2000) observed that SFA values for these spreads ranged between 11.9% and 29.4%, with a mean value of 22.4%. Their observed MUFA values ranged between 29.0% and 43.2% with the mean value 36.5%, and PUFA values ranged be- tween 31.30% and 41.90% with the mean value 36.2%. In our study, SFA content was observed as 38.46%-62.81% in chocolates and 34.75-87.18% in chocolate wafers. MUFA content was determined as 28.06%-53.87% in chocolates and 7.62-53.01% in chocolate wafers. PUFA content was observed, to be 4.09%-15.24% in chocolates and 4.32-20.52% in chocolate wafers (Table 3). Indicating that, SFA levels were higher in Turkey than in Austria but PUFA levels were lower than in Austria.

KARABULUT (2007) investigated fatty acids com- positions and TFAs contents in 134 frequently consumed foods including 19 samples of chocolates in Turkey. The author categorised 7 groups of chocolates. He stated that chocolate samples con- tained TFAs less than 0.17 g/100 g fatty acids, with the exceptional national product of chocolate bars and hazelnut cocoa cream (2.03 and 3.68 g/100 g fatty acids, respectively). He observed that the dark and bitter chocolate samples were found as trans free products in their categories. In our

study, we analysed more chocolate samples for fatty acids composition and TFAs content than did KARABULUT (2007). Similarly, we found that bitter chocolates were trans free products. KARABULUT (2007) found that chocolate bar and coconut bar covered with chocolate contained the highest lauric acid (24.87-13.60%) and myristic acid (9.38-9.27%) contents. Similarly, in our study, pure chocolate wafers and chocolate wafers with nuts contained higher levels of lauric (5.11-4.08%) and myristic (2.97-2.14%) acids than other groups.

MOJSKA et al. (2006) determined TFAs in foods in Poland including 12 chocolate products. TFAs were detected to make 7.86% in the chocolate products. We observed that the minimum-maximum range of TFAs content was 0.00-6.23% for chocolates and 0.00-7.92% for chocolate wafers. INNIS et al. (1999) determined TFAs content in over 200 foods includ- ing 9 chocolate bars in Canada. They observed that TFAs content varied between 0.1% and 35.9% with average values 9.16% in chocolate bars. They stated that the use of average values for theTFAs content in a food category was of a limited value.

Fu et al. (2008) investigated TFAs in national- brand western-style products including 10 choco- late samples in China. The authors determined the average contents of TFAs as 0.80%, 0.57%, and 1.87% of total fatty acids in chocolate with nuts, dark chocolate, and milk chocolate, respectively. In our study, we determined the average TFAs contents as 1.02%, 0.00%, and 0.18% of total fatty acids in chocolate with nuts, bitter chocolate, and milk chocolate, respectively.

The body of short-term randomised feeding trials suggest that cocoa and chocolate may ex- ert beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk via lowering the blood pressure, anti-inflammation, anti-platelet function, higher HDL, and decreased LDL oxidation (DING et al. 2006). Similarly, MURSU et al. (2004) stated that cocoa polyphenols may increase the concentration of HDL cholesterol. The consumption of cocoa with dark chocolate increased the serum concentration of HDL cho- lesterol by 4% (WAN et al. 2001). Cocoa butter, a fat derived from cocoa plants and predominantly found in dark chocolate (KRIS-ETHERTON et al. 1993) contains on average 33% of oleic acid, 25% of palmitic acid, and 33% of stearic acid (USDA National Nutrient Database http://www.nal.usda. gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/). Similarly, in our study, in bitter chocolates, palmitic, oleic, and stearic acids contents were determined as 25.11%,

33.80%, and 34.66%, respectively. Stearic acid was suggested to be a non-atherogenic type of dietary saturated fat (DING et al. 2006) and the most recent trial also shows the effects of stearic acid on lipids to be even similar to those of oleic and linoleic acids (THIJSSEN & MENSINK 2005).

The results of this research have demonstrated that fatty acids composition and TFAs contents of chocolate vary. As a result of the extensive cov- erage of the present research which included all chocolate and chocolate wafers brands in Turkey, it was shown that trans fatty acid levels in chocolates and chocolate wafers on Turkish markets were relatively lower than those of other countries.
