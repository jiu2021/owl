Searching can provide a broader perspective and help validate existing knowledge.  \n- If one way fails to provide an answer, try other ways or methods. The answer does exists.\n- If the search snippet is unhelpful but the URL comes from an authoritative source, try visit the website for more details.  \n- When looking for specific numerical values (e.g., dollar amounts), prioritize reliable sources and avoid relying only on search snippets.  \n- When solving tasks that require web searches, check Wikipedia first before exploring other websites.  \n- You can also simulate browser actions to get more information or verify the information you have found.\n- Browser simulation is also helpful for finding target URLs. Browser simulation operations do not necessarily need to find specific answers, but can also help find web page URLs that contain answers (usually difficult to find through simple web searches). You can find the answer to the question by performing subsequent operations on the URL, such as extracting the content of the webpage.\n- Do not solely rely on document tools or browser simulation to find the answer, you should combine document tools and browser simulation to comprehensively process web page information. Some content may need to do browser simulation to get, or some content is rendered by javascript.\n- In your response, you should mention the urls you have visited and processed.\n\nHere are some tips that help you perform web search:\n- Never add too many keywords in your search query! Some detailed results need to perform browser interaction to get, not using search toolkit.\n- If the question is complex, search results typically do not provide precise answers. It is not likely to find the answer directly using search toolkit only, the search query should be concise and focuses on finding official sources rather than direct answers.\n  For example, as for the question \"What is the maximum length in meters of #9 in the first National Geographic short on YouTube that was ever released according to the Monterey Bay Aquarium website?\", your first search term must be coarse-grained like \"National Geographic YouTube\" to find the youtube website first, and then try other fine-grained search terms step-by-step to find more urls.\n- The results you return do not have to directly answer the original question, you only need to collect relevant information.\n"

Milhouse is [Bart Simpson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bart_Simpson \"Bart Simpson\")\\'s childhood best friend in [Mrs. Krabappel\\'s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edna_Krabappel \"Edna Krabappel\") fourth grade class at [Springfield Elementary School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springfield_(The_Simpsons)#Springfield_Elementary_School \"Springfield (The Simpsons)\"). He is insecure, gullible, and is often led into trouble by Bart, who takes advantage of his friend\\'s naivety. Milhouse is a regular target for school bully [Nelson Muntz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Muntz \"Nelson Muntz\") and his friends [Jimbo Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimbo_Jones \"Jimbo Jones\"), [Dolph Starbeam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolph_Starbeam \"Dolph Starbeam\") and [Kearney Zzyzwicz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kearney_Zzyzwicz \"Kearney Zzyzwicz\"). He has a crush on Bart\\'s sister, [Lisa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Simpson \"Lisa Simpson\"), which is a common plot element.\\n\\nMilhouse debuted in the 1988 [commercial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_advertisement \"Television advertisement\") \"The [Butterfinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfinger \"Butterfinger\") Group\" while _The Simpsons_ was still airing as a cartoon short series on the Fox [variety show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_show \"Variety show\") _[The Tracey Ullman Show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tracey_Ullman_Show \"The Tracey Ullman Show\")_. When _The Simpsons_ was greenlit for a full series by Fox, Milhouse appeared in the first episode of [the first season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons_season_1 \"The Simpsons season 1\"), \" [Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpsons_Roasting_on_an_Open_Fire \"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\"),\" becoming one of the series\\' most prominent recurring characters. Groening chose the name Milhouse, also the middle name of [President Richard Nixon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon \"Richard Nixon\"), because it was the most \"unfortunate name \\\\[he\\\\] could think of for a kid\".[\\\\[4\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milhouse_Van_Houten#cite_note-tvguide-4) Milhouse\\'s appearance is based on that of [Rob Cohen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cohen_(writer) \"Robert Cohen (writer)\").[\\\\[5\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milhouse_Van_Houten#cite_note-gould-5) In the wake of Pamela Hayden\\'s retirement in November 2024, it was confirmed that her characters, including Milhouse, would be recast in the future.[\\\\[6\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milhouse_Van_Houten#cite_note-6) Following Hayden\\'s appearance in _The Simpsons_ [Disney+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney%2B \"Disney+\") special [O C\\'mon All Ye Faithful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O_C%27mon_All_Ye_Faithful \"O C\\'mon All Ye Faithful\"), _Simpsons_ creator Matt Groening and writer [Carolyn Omine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolyn_Omine \"Carolyn Omine\") revealed to _Comic Book.com_ that Hayden would make a few more performances than initially announced.[\\\\[7\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milhouse_Van_Houten#cite_note-7)\\n\\n## Profile\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Milhouse_Van_Houten&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Profile\")\\\\]\\n\\nMilhouse is of Italian, Greek, Danish and Dutch descent, based on comments and characters introduced throughout the series. He shares the same physical features as both his parents, and his father\\'s primary personality features (which include disappointment, insecurity, and generally depressed demeanor). He has none of his mother\\'s confidence, except when specific storylines demand it. Milhouse is constantly bullied by [Nelson Muntz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Muntz \"Nelson Muntz\"), [Jimbo Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recurring_The_Simpsons_characters#Jimbo_Jones \"List of recurring The Simpsons characters\"), [Dolph Starbeam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recurring_The_Simpsons_characters#Dolph_Starbeam \"List of recurring The Simpsons characters\"), and [Kearney Zzyzwicz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recurring_The_Simpsons_characters#Kearney_Zzyzwicz \"List of recurring The Simpsons characters\"), to the point that when Bart questions Milhouse by saying \"Milhouse! I thought you had a three o\\'clock [wedgie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedgie \"Wedgie\") with Nelson\", in the episode \" [Little Orphan Millie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Orphan_Millie \"Little Orphan Millie\")\", Milhouse simply responds \"I had to reschedule\". They do often inflict violence upon the geeky Milhouse, who wears thick eyeglasses, without which he cannot see. Milhouse and family are among the few Springfield residents with visible eyebrows, which are rather thick.\\n\\nAlthough not disliked and having a moderate number of friends among other kids from school aside from Bart himself, Milhouse has made a career of getting victimized, although his overall true antagonists are the schoolyard bullies of [Springfield Elementary School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springfield_(The_Simpsons)#Springfield_Elementary_School \"Springfield (The Simpsons)\") (Nelson, Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney). In \" [Sideshow Bob Roberts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sideshow_Bob_Roberts \"Sideshow Bob Roberts\")\", Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney wrapped Milhouse in [bumper stickers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumper_sticker \"Bumper sticker\") and placed him in a [shopping cart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopping_cart \"Shopping cart\"). After Jimbo claimed that \"the [mummy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mummy \"Mummy\")\\'s ready for his mystical journey!\", the bullies pushed the cart with Milhouse down a very steep hill. He is harmed frequently, and on some occasions is injured by dangerous hazards, e.g., being run over by a train, falling down a waterfall, receiving electrical shocks, having his head polished to bone, and having his teeth knocked out by a hockey puck. As a lead character he always survives and recovers, often with no further mention of any injuries. He frequently visited a female psychiatrist until even she could not deal with his constant calling and blocked his number.\\n\\nOn one occasion, Bart got Milhouse placed on the [FBI\\'s Most Wanted List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI_Ten_Most_Wanted_Fugitives \"FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives\") even though they are friends, and tried to lure Milhouse into a cactus. Milhouse is not always subservient to Bart; in \" [Bart Sells His Soul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bart_Sells_His_Soul \"Bart Sells His Soul\")\", Milhouse toyed with Bart\\'s anxiety after Bart sold his soul for $5, and Milhouse demanded $50 to return it. On another occasion, Bart introduced Milhouse to his girlfriend and had to explain why he and Milhouse are friends, but could not come up with a good answer and admitted it was due to geographical convenience. Bart did admit in \" [Little Orphan Millie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Orphan_Millie \"Little Orphan Millie\")\" that he loves Milhouse.[\\\\[8\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milhouse_Van_Houten#cite_note-8)\\n\\nHomer also sometimes makes fun of Milhouse (once referring to Milhouse in the boy\\'s presence as \"that little wiener\"). In \" [Burns, Baby Burns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burns,_Baby_Burns \"Burns, Baby Burns\")\", Larry, [Mr. Burns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Burns \"Mr. Burns\")\\' son, brings Homer to eat at his house. Mr. Burns was angry and he asks Homer if his son \"brings home nitwits and make you talk to them\", to which Homer answers \"Oh, all the time! Have you ever heard of this kid Milhouse? He\\'s a little wiener who...\", before being interrupted by Burns. In an attempt to purposefully enrage his father, Bart once stated that he felt \"a little attracted to Milhouse\", sending Homer into a rage. Bart and Milhouse appear to be the same height, but in the episode \" [Radioactive Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_Man_(The_Simpsons_episode) \"Radioactive Man (The Simpsons episode)\")\", it is revealed that Milhouse is at least 1\\xa0in (25\\xa0mm) taller than Bart.\\n\\nMilhouse is frequently the butt of a variety of jokes, such as being beaten up by Nelson for delivering a love note from Lisa (which Nelson thought was from Milhouse himself), having the door slammed in his face while playing [pin the tail on the donkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pin_the_tail_on_the_donkey \"Pin the tail on the donkey\"), having his possible budding homosexuality given away by his school counselor to Homer and Marge by accidentally picking up the wrong folder while discussing Bart, making him a wanted fugitive (see above), inadvertently inheriting Bart\\'s dismal permanent record at school through a side deal arranged between Bart, Edna Krabappel and [Principal Skinner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_Skinner \"Principal Skinner\"), which will disqualify Milhouse from \"all but the hottest and noisiest jobs\".\\n\\nHe is fluent in [Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language \"Italian language\") (\" [The Last of the Red Hat Mamas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_the_Red_Hat_Mamas \"The Last of the Red Hat Mamas\")\") due to visiting his maternal grandmother in [Tuscany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuscany \"Tuscany\") for two weeks every year. She hates the English language and would beat him whenever he spoke English, so he was forced to learn Italian. He began bed-wetting from this experience. He helps Lisa learn Italian, but there is no reference to his Italian background or language skills in any other episode. Milhouse\\'s personality drastically changes when speaking Italian, becoming a suave, confident ladies\\' man popular with Springfield\\'s [Italian community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Americans \"Italian Americans\") in the episode. It is later revealed that both Milhouse\\'s middle name and his maternal family name are \" [Mussolini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mussolini_family \"Mussolini family\")\".\\n\\nThe show\\'s [opening sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons_opening_sequence \"The Simpsons opening sequence\"), and various scenes of band practice suggests that Milhouse plays a brass or woodwind instrument, possibly clarinet or trumpet, but all the Springfield Elementary band members, besides Lisa, are very poor musicians.\\n\\nMilhouse is allergic to honey, [wheat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat \"Wheat\"), [dairy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_product \"Dairy product\"), mistletoe, holly, the red parts of candy canes, and his own tears.\\n\\n### Romance\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Milhouse_Van_Houten&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Romance\")\\\\]\\n\\nMilhouse harbors an occasionally reciprocated crush on Lisa, but their relationship is never shown as anything other than acquaintance or friendship. As shown in \" [Lisa\\'s Date with Density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa%27s_Date_with_Density \"Lisa\\'s Date with Density\")\", when she admits she liked Nelson – at the end of that episode, after she has stopped liking Nelson, Milhouse asks Lisa who will be her next crush; Lisa coyly answers that it could be anybody and Milhouse rejoices.\\n\\nLisa has always opposed the idea of going out with Milhouse (e.g. \"Lisa\\'s Date with Density\" and \" [Future-Drama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future-Drama \"Future-Drama\")\"); however, in the episode \" [The Last of the Red Hat Mamas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_the_Red_Hat_Mamas \"The Last of the Red Hat Mamas\")\", after Milhouse starts tutoring Lisa in Italian and takes her to Springfield\\'s Little Italy, she begins to develop feelings for him, until she catches him with a girl named Angelica, and began cursing in Italian and chasing him with a branch just as his grandmother had done.\\n\\nMilhouse\\'s first real girlfriend was Samantha Stanky, a new student who had moved to [Springfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springfield_(The_Simpsons) \"Springfield (The Simpsons)\") from [Phoenix, Arizona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona \"Phoenix, Arizona\") in the episode \" [Bart\\'s Friend Falls in Love](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bart%27s_Friend_Falls_in_Love \"Bart\\'s Friend Falls in Love\")\". After her father who responds to Bart\\'s call caught her and Milhouse kissing, he shipped her off to a Catholic girls\\' school run by French-Canadian nuns. While Milhouse\\'s official first kiss was with Samantha in the aforementioned episode, it was contradicted in the episode \" [The Way We Weren\\'t](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Way_We_Weren%27t \"The Way We Weren\\'t\")\", where Milhouse accidentally kisses [Homer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer_Simpson \"Homer Simpson\"), during a game of [spin the bottle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_the_bottle \"Spin the bottle\") that Homer interrupted. In the episode \" [Homer Scissorhands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer_Scissorhands \"Homer Scissorhands\")\", Milhouse dated fifth grader Taffy. The relationship ended when Milhouse and Taffy caught Lisa spying on them in the bushes. Taffy told Lisa that Milhouse still loves her, and Lisa kisses Milhouse because \"he looks cute in the moonlight\". Lisa told Milhouse that he should not give up searching for other girls and that life has unexpected things to offer. In the episode \" [The Bart Wants What It Wants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bart_Wants_What_It_Wants \"The Bart Wants What It Wants\")\", Milhouse has a romantic relationship with Greta Wolfcastle, daughter of film star Rainier Wolfcastle.\\n\\nMilhouse and Lisa\\'s relationship has been used in episodes set in the show\\'s future, outside of the show\\'s [canon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(fiction) \"Canon (fiction)\")\\\\[ _[according to whom?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions \"Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch\")_\\\\]. In the episode \" [Lisa\\'s Wedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa%27s_Wedding \"Lisa\\'s Wedding\")\", set 15 years into the future, Milhouse is Homer\\'s boss at the nuclear plant, and after learning of Lisa\\'s impending marriage, Milhouse recalls an earlier date with Lisa in which she said she might never marry, then angrily prepares Homer\\'s annual review. Later in the episode, Lisa wonders if it is acceptable to wear a white wedding dress, suggesting that she had already lost her virginity; Marge tells her, \"Milhouse doesn\\'t count\". In the episode \" [Holidays of Future Passed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holidays_of_Future_Passed \"Holidays of Future Passed\")\" (2011), set 30 years into the future, Lisa and Milhouse are married and have a daughter, Zia.\\n\\n## Creation\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Milhouse_Van_Houten&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Creation\")\\\\]\\n\\nMilhouse was designed by [Matt Groening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Groening \"Matt Groening\") for a planned series on [NBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC \"NBC\"), which was abandoned.[\\\\[9\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milhouse_Van_Houten#cite_note-9) The design was then used for a _[Butterfinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfinger \"Butterfinger\")_ commercial, and it was decided to use the character in the series.[\\\\[10\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milhouse_Van_Houten#cite_note-10)[\\\\[11\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milhouse_Van_Houten#cite_note-11) Milhouse was named after U.S. president [Richard Milhous Nixon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Milhous_Nixon \"Richard Milhous Nixon\"). The name was the most \"unfortunate name Matt Groening could think of for a kid\".[\\\\[4\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milhouse_Van_Houten#cite_note-tvguide-4) Years earlier, in a 1986 _[Life in Hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_in_Hell \"Life in Hell\")_ comic entitled \"What to Name the Baby\", Groening listed Milhouse as a name \"no longer recommended\".[\\\\[12\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milhouse_Van_Houten#cite_note-hugehell-12) Milhouse is a favorite among the staff as [Al Jean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jean \"Al Jean\") noted \"most of the writers are more like Milhouse than Bart\".[\\\\[4\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milhouse_Van_Houten#cite_note-tvguide-4) His last name was given to him by [Howard Gewirtz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Gewirtz \"Howard Gewirtz\"), a freelance writer who wrote the episode \" [Homer Defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer_Defined \"Homer Defined\")\".

Searching can provide a broader perspective and help validate existing knowledge.  \n- If one way fails to provide an answer, try other ways or methods. The answer does exists.\n- If the search snippet is unhelpful but the URL comes from an authoritative source, try visit the website for more details.  \n- When looking for specific numerical values (e.g., dollar amounts), prioritize reliable sources and avoid relying only on search snippets.  \n- When solving tasks that require web searches, check Wikipedia first before exploring other websites.  \n- You can also simulate browser actions to get more information or verify the information you have found.\n- Browser simulation is also helpful for finding target URLs. Browser simulation operations do not necessarily need to find specific answers, but can also help find web page URLs that contain answers (usually difficult to find through simple web searches). You can find the answer to the question by performing subsequent operations on the URL, such as extracting the content of the webpage.\n- Do not solely rely on document tools or browser simulation to find the answer, you should combine document tools and browser simulation to comprehensively process web page information. Some content may need to do browser simulation to get, or some content is rendered by javascript.\n- In your response, you should mention the urls you have visited and processed.\n\nHere are some tips that help you perform web search:\n- Never add too many keywords in your search query! Some detailed results need to perform browser interaction to get, not using search toolkit.\n- If the question is complex, search results typically do not provide precise answers. It is not likely to find the answer directly using search toolkit only, the search query should be concise and focuses on finding official sources rather than direct answers.\n  For example, as for the question \"What is the maximum length in meters of #9 in the first National Geographic short on YouTube that was ever released according to the Monterey Bay Aquarium website?\", your first search term must be coarse-grained like \"National Geographic YouTube\" to find the youtube website first, and then try other fine-grained search terms step-by-step to find more urls.\n- The results you return do not have to directly answer the original question, you only need to collect relevant information.\n"

Milhouse is Bart Simpson\\'s childhood best friend in Mrs. Krabappel\\'s fourth grade class at Springfield Elementary School. He is insecure, gullible, and is often led into trouble by Bart, who takes advantage of his friend\\'s naivety. Milhouse is a regular target for school bully Nelson Muntz and his friends Jimbo Jones, Dolph Starbeam and Kearney Zzyzwicz. He has a crush on Bart\\'s sister, Lisa, which is a common plot element.\\nMilhouse debuted in the 1988 commercial \"The Butterfinger Group\" while The Simpsons was still airing as a cartoon short series on the Fox variety show The Tracey Ullman Show. When The Simpsons was greenlit for a full series by Fox, Milhouse appeared in the first episode of the first season, \"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire,\" becoming one of the series\\' most prominent recurring characters. Groening chose the name Milhouse, also the middle name of President Richard Nixon, because it was the most \"unfortunate name [he] could think of for a kid\". Milhouse\\'s appearance is based on that of Rob Cohen. In the wake of Pamela Hayden\\'s retirement in November 2024, it was confirmed that her characters, including Milhouse, would be recast in the future. Following Hayden\\'s appearance in The Simpsons Disney+ special O C\\'mon All Ye Faithful, Simpsons creator Matt Groening and writer Carolyn Omine revealed to Comic Book.com that Hayden would make a few more performances than initially announced.\\n\\n\\n== Profile ==\\nMilhouse is of Italian, Greek, Danish and Dutch descent, based on comments and characters introduced throughout the series. He shares the same physical features as both his parents, and his father\\'s primary personality features (which include disappointment, insecurity, and generally depressed demeanor).  He has none of his mother\\'s confidence, except when specific storylines demand it. Milhouse is constantly bullied by Nelson Muntz, Jimbo Jones, Dolph Starbeam, and Kearney Zzyzwicz, to the point that when Bart questions Milhouse by saying \"Milhouse! I thought you had a three o\\'clock wedgie with Nelson\", in the episode \"Little Orphan Millie\", Milhouse simply responds \"I had to reschedule\". They do often inflict violence upon the geeky Milhouse, who wears thick eyeglasses, without which he cannot see. Milhouse and family are among the few Springfield residents with visible eyebrows, which are rather thick.\\nAlthough not disliked and having a moderate number of friends among other kids from school aside from Bart himself, Milhouse has made a career of getting victimized, although his overall true antagonists are the schoolyard bullies of Springfield Elementary School (Nelson, Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney). In \"Sideshow Bob Roberts\", Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney wrapped Milhouse in bumper stickers and placed him in a shopping cart. After Jimbo claimed that \"the mummy\\'s ready for his mystical journey!\", the bullies pushed the cart with Milhouse down a very steep hill. He is harmed frequently, and on some occasions is injured by dangerous hazards, e.g., being run over by a train, falling down a waterfall, receiving electrical shocks, having his head polished to bone, and having his teeth knocked out by a hockey puck.  As a lead character he always survives and recovers, often with no further mention of any injuries. He frequently visited a female psychiatrist until even she could not deal with his constant calling and blocked his number.\\nOn one occasion, Bart got Milhouse placed on the FBI\\'s Most Wanted List even though they are friends, and tried to lure Milhouse into a cactus. Milhouse is not always subservient to Bart; in \"Bart Sells His Soul\", Milhouse toyed with Bart\\'s anxiety after Bart sold his soul for $5, and Milhouse demanded $50 to return it. On another occasion, Bart introduced Milhouse to his girlfriend and had to explain why he and Milhouse are friends, but could not come up with a good answer and admitted it was due to geographical convenience. Bart did admit in \"Little Orphan Millie\" that he loves Milhouse.\\nHomer also sometimes makes fun of  Milhouse (once referring to Milhouse in the boy\\'s presence as \"that little wiener\"). In \"Burns, Baby Burns\", Larry, Mr. Burns\\' son, brings Homer to eat at his house. Mr. Burns was angry and he asks Homer if his son \"brings home nitwits and make you talk to them\", to which Homer answers \"Oh, all the time! Have you ever heard of this kid Milhouse? He\\'s a little wiener who...\", before being interrupted by Burns. In an attempt to purposefully enrage his father, Bart once stated that he felt \"a little attracted to Milhouse\", sending Homer into a rage. Bart and Milhouse appear to be the same height, but in the episode \"Radioactive Man\", it is revealed that Milhouse is at least 1 in (25 mm) taller than Bart.\\nMilhouse is frequently the butt of a variety of jokes, such as being beaten up by Nelson for delivering a love note from Lisa (which Nelson thought was from Milhouse himself), having the door slammed in his face while playing pin the tail on the donkey, having his possible budding homosexuality given away by his school counselor to Homer and Marge by accidentally picking up the wrong folder while discussing Bart, making him a wanted fugitive (see above), inadvertently inheriting Bart\\'s dismal permanent record at school through a side deal arranged between Bart, Edna Krabappel and Principal Skinner, which will disqualify Milhouse from \"all but the hottest and noisiest jobs\".\\nHe is fluent in Italian (\"The Last of the Red Hat Mamas\") due to visiting his maternal grandmother in Tuscany for two weeks every year. She hates the English language and would beat him whenever he spoke English, so he was forced to learn Italian. He began bed-wetting from this experience. He helps Lisa learn Italian, but there is no reference to his Italian background or language skills in any other episode. Milhouse\\'s personality drastically changes when speaking Italian, becoming a suave, confident ladies\\' man popular with Springfield\\'s Italian community in the episode. It is later revealed that both Milhouse\\'s middle name and his maternal family name are \"Mussolini\".\\nThe show\\'s opening sequence, and various scenes of band practice suggests that Milhouse plays a brass or woodwind instrument, possibly clarinet or trumpet, but all the Springfield Elementary band members, besides Lisa, are very poor musicians.\\nMilhouse is allergic to honey, wheat, dairy,  mistletoe, holly, the red parts of candy canes, and his own tears.\\n\\n\\n=== Romance ===\\nMilhouse harbors an occasionally reciprocated crush on Lisa, but their relationship is never shown as anything other than acquaintance or friendship. As shown in \"Lisa\\'s Date with Density\", when she admits she liked Nelson – at the end of that episode, after she has stopped liking Nelson, Milhouse asks Lisa who will be her next crush; Lisa coyly answers that it could be anybody and Milhouse rejoices.\\nLisa has always opposed the idea of going out with Milhouse (e.g. \"Lisa\\'s Date with Density\" and \"Future-Drama\"); however, in the episode \"The Last of the Red Hat Mamas\", after Milhouse starts tutoring Lisa in Italian and takes her to Springfield\\'s Little Italy, she begins to develop feelings for him, until she catches him with a girl named Angelica, and began cursing in Italian and chasing him with a branch just as his grandmother had done.\\nMilhouse\\'s first real girlfriend was Samantha Stanky, a new student who had moved to Springfield from Phoenix, Arizona in the episode \"Bart\\'s Friend Falls in Love\". After her father who responds to Bart\\'s call caught her and Milhouse kissing, he shipped her off to a Catholic girls\\' school run by French-Canadian nuns. While Milhouse\\'s official first kiss was with Samantha in the aforementioned episode, it was contradicted in the episode \"The Way We Weren\\'t\", where Milhouse accidentally kisses Homer, during a game of spin the bottle that Homer interrupted. In the episode \"Homer Scissorhands\", Milhouse dated fifth grader Taffy. The relationship ended when Milhouse and Taffy caught Lisa spying on them in the bushes. Taffy told Lisa that Milhouse still loves her, and Lisa kisses Milhouse because \"he looks cute in the moonlight\". Lisa told Milhouse that he should not give up searching for other girls and that life has unexpected things to offer. In the episode \"The Bart Wants What It Wants\", Milhouse has a romantic relationship with Greta Wolfcastle, daughter of film star Rainier Wolfcastle.\\nMilhouse and Lisa\\'s relationship has been used in episodes set in the show\\'s future, outside of the show\\'s canon. In the episode \"Lisa\\'s Wedding\", set 15 years into the future, Milhouse is Homer\\'s boss at the nuclear plant, and after learning of Lisa\\'s impending marriage, Milhouse recalls an earlier date with Lisa in which she said she might never marry, then angrily prepares Homer\\'s annual review. Later in the episode, Lisa wonders if it is acceptable to wear a white wedding dress, suggesting that she had already lost her virginity; Marge tells her, \"Milhouse doesn\\'t count\". In the episode \"Holidays of Future Passed\" (2011), set 30 years into the future, Lisa and Milhouse are married and have a daughter, Zia.\\n\\n\\n== Creation ==\\nMilhouse was designed by Matt Groening for a planned series on NBC, which was abandoned. The design was then used for a Butterfinger commercial, and it was decided to use the character in the series. Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Milhous Nixon. The name was the most \"unfortunate name Matt Groening could think of for a kid\". Years earlier, in a 1986 Life in Hell comic entitled \"What to Name the Baby\", Groening listed Milhouse as a name \"no longer recommended\". Milhouse is a favorite among the staff as Al Jean noted \"most of the writers are more like Milhouse than Bart\". His last name was given to him by Howard Gewirtz, a freelance writer who wrote the episode \"Homer Defined\". Gewirtz got the name from one of his wife\\'s friends. According to Arden Myrin and Dana Gould (former writer and co-executive producer of The Simpsons), Rob Cohen (Simpsons writer) inspired Milhouse\\'s look.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nThe Milhouse File\\nMilhouse Van Houten on IMDb'}",

Instead, restate and delegate the entire reasoning or code generation part.\nWhen a task involves knowledge-based content (such as formulas, constants, or factual information), agents must use the search tool to retrieve up-to-date and authoritative sources for verification. Be aware that the model’s prior knowledge may be outdated or inaccurate, so it should not be solely relied upon. Your decomposition of subtasks must explicitly reflect this, i.e. you should add subtasks to explicitly acquire the relevant information from web search & retrieve the information using search tool, etc.\n\nWhen performing a task, you need to determine whether it should be completed using code execution instead of step-by-step tool interactions. Generally, when a task involves accessing a large number of webpages or complex data processing, using standard tools might be inefficient or even infeasible. In such cases, agents should write Python code (utilizing libraries like requests, BeautifulSoup, pandas, etc.) to automate the process. Here are some scenarios where using code is the preferred approach:\n1. Tasks requiring access to a large number of webpages. Example: \"How many times was a Twitter/X post cited as a reference on English Wikipedia pages for each day of August in the last June 2023 versions of the pages?\" Reason: Manually checking each Wikipedia page would be highly inefficient, while Python code can systematically fetch and process the required data.\n2. Data processing involving complex filtering or calculations. Example: \"Analyze all article titles on Hacker News in March 2024 and find the top 10 most frequently occurring keywords.\" Reason: This task requires processing a large amount of text data, which is best handled programmatically.\n3. Cross-referencing information from multiple data sources. Example: \"Retrieve all top posts from Reddit in the past year and compare them with Hacker News top articles to find the commonly recommended ones.\" Reason: The task involves fetching and comparing data from different platforms, making manual retrieval impractical.\n4. Repetitive query tasks. Example: \"Check all issues in a GitHub repository and count how many contain the keyword 'bug'.\" Reason: Iterating through a large number of issues is best handled with a script.\nIf the task needs writing code, do not forget to remind the agent to execute the written code, and report the result after executing the code.\n\nHere are some additional tips for you:\n- Though it's not a must, you should try your best effort to make each subtask achievable for a worker.\n- You don't need to explicitly mention what tools to use and what workers to use in the subtasks, just let the agent decide what to do.\n- Your decomposed subtasks should be clear and concrete, without any ambiguity. The subtasks should always be consistent with the overall task.\n- You need to flexibly adjust the number of subtasks according to the steps of the overall task. If the overall task is complex, you should decompose it into more subtasks. Otherwise, you should decompose it into less subtasks (e.g. 2-3 subtasks).\n- There are some intermediate steps that cannot be answered in one step. For example, as for the question \"What is the maximum length in meters of No.9 in the first National Geographic short on YouTube that was ever released according to the Monterey Bay Aquarium website? Just give the number.\", It is impossible to directly find \"No.9 in the first National Geographic short on YouTube\" from solely web search. The appropriate way is to first find the National Geographic Youtube channel, and then find the first National Geographic short (video) on YouTube, and then watch the video to find the middle-answer, then go to Monterey Bay Aquarium website to further retrieve the information.\n- If the task mentions some sources (e.g. youtube, girls who code, nature, etc.), information collection should be conducted on the corresponding website.\n- You should add a subtask to verify the ultimate answer. The agents should try other ways to verify the answer, e.g. using different tools.\n"
