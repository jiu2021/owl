It is not likely to find the answer directly using search toolkit only, the search query should be concise and focuses on finding official sources rather than direct answers.\n  For example, as for the question \"What is the maximum length in meters of #9 in the first National Geographic short on YouTube that was ever released according to the Monterey Bay Aquarium website?\", your first search term must be coarse-grained like \"National Geographic YouTube\" to find the youtube website first, and then try other fine-grained search terms step-by-step to find more urls.\n- The results you return do not have to directly answer the original question, you only need to collect relevant information.\n"

Searching can provide a broader perspective and help validate existing knowledge.  \n- If one way fails to provide an answer, try other ways or methods. The answer does exists.\n- If the search snippet is unhelpful but the URL comes from an authoritative source, try visit the website for more details.  \n- When looking for specific numerical values (e.g., dollar amounts), prioritize reliable sources and avoid relying only on search snippets.  \n- When solving tasks that require web searches, check Wikipedia first before exploring other websites.  \n- You can also simulate browser actions to get more information or verify the information you have found.\n- Browser simulation is also helpful for finding target URLs. Browser simulation operations do not necessarily need to find specific answers, but can also help find web page URLs that contain answers (usually difficult to find through simple web searches). You can find the answer to the question by performing subsequent operations on the URL, such as extracting the content of the webpage.\n- Do not solely rely on document tools or browser simulation to find the answer, you should combine document tools and browser simulation to comprehensively process web page information. Some content may need to do browser simulation to get, or some content is rendered by javascript.\n- In your response, you should mention the urls you have visited and processed.\n\nHere are some tips that help you perform web search:\n- Never add too many keywords in your search query! Some detailed results need to perform browser interaction to get, not using search toolkit.\n- If the question is complex, search results typically do not provide precise answers. It is not likely to find the answer directly using search toolkit only, the search query should be concise and focuses on finding official sources rather than direct answers.\n  For example, as for the question \"What is the maximum length in meters of #9 in the first National Geographic short on YouTube that was ever released according to the Monterey Bay Aquarium website?\", your first search term must be coarse-grained like \"National Geographic YouTube\" to find the youtube website first, and then try other fine-grained search terms step-by-step to find more urls.\n- The results you return do not have to directly answer the original question, you only need to collect relevant information.\n"

However, it cannot access the internet to search for information. If the task requires python execution, it should be informed to execute the code after writing it.>:<tools: execute_code, extract_excel_content, extract_document_content>\n\n==============================\n\nYou must return the subtasks in the format of a numbered list within <tasks> tags, as shown below:\n\n<tasks>\n<task>Subtask 1</task>\n<task>Subtask 2</task>\n</tasks>\n\nIn the final subtask, you should explicitly transform the original problem into a special format to let the agent to make the final answer about the original problem.\nHowever, if a task requires reasoning or code generation and does not rely on external knowledge (e.g., web search), DO NOT decompose the reasoning or code generation part. Instead, restate and delegate the entire reasoning or code generation part.\nWhen a task involves knowledge-based content (such as formulas, constants, or factual information), agents must use the search tool to retrieve up-to-date and authoritative sources for verification. Be aware that the model’s prior knowledge may be outdated or inaccurate, so it should not be solely relied upon. Your decomposition of subtasks must explicitly reflect this, i.e. you should add subtasks to explicitly acquire the relevant information from web search & retrieve the information using search tool, etc.\n\nWhen performing a task, you need to determine whether it should be completed using code execution instead of step-by-step tool interactions. Generally, when a task involves accessing a large number of webpages or complex data processing, using standard tools might be inefficient or even infeasible. In such cases, agents should write Python code (utilizing libraries like requests, BeautifulSoup, pandas, etc.) to automate the process. Here are some scenarios where using code is the preferred approach:\n1. Tasks requiring access to a large number of webpages. Example: \"How many times was a Twitter/X post cited as a reference on English Wikipedia pages for each day of August in the last June 2023 versions of the pages?\" Reason: Manually checking each Wikipedia page would be highly inefficient, while Python code can systematically fetch and process the required data.\n2. Data processing involving complex filtering or calculations. Example: \"Analyze all article titles on Hacker News in March 2024 and find the top 10 most frequently occurring keywords.\" Reason: This task requires processing a large amount of text data, which is best handled programmatically.\n3. Cross-referencing information from multiple data sources. Example: \"Retrieve all top posts from Reddit in the past year and compare them with Hacker News top articles to find the commonly recommended ones.\" Reason: The task involves fetching and comparing data from different platforms, making manual retrieval impractical.\n4. Repetitive query tasks. Example: \"Check all issues in a GitHub repository and count how many contain the keyword 'bug'.\" Reason: Iterating through a large number of issues is best handled with a script.\nIf the task needs writing code, do not forget to remind the agent to execute the written code, and report the result after executing the code.\n\nHere are some additional tips for you:\n- Though it's not a must, you should try your best effort to make each subtask achievable for a worker.\n- You don't need to explicitly mention what tools to use and what workers to use in the subtasks, just let the agent decide what to do.\n- Your decomposed subtasks should be clear and concrete, without any ambiguity. The subtasks should always be consistent with the overall task.\n- You need to flexibly adjust the number of subtasks according to the steps of the overall task. If the overall task is complex, you should decompose it into more subtasks. Otherwise, you should decompose it into less subtasks (e.g. 2-3 subtasks).\n- There are some intermediate steps that cannot be answered in one step. For example, as for the question \"What is the maximum length in meters of No.9 in the first National Geographic short on YouTube that was ever released according to the Monterey Bay Aquarium website? Just give the number.\", It is impossible to directly find \"No.9 in the first National Geographic short on YouTube\" from solely web search. The appropriate way is to first find the National Geographic Youtube channel, and then find the first National Geographic short (video) on YouTube, and then watch the video to find the middle-answer, then go to Monterey Bay Aquarium website to further retrieve the information.\n- If the task mentions some sources (e.g. youtube, girls who code, nature, etc.), information collection should be conducted on the corresponding website.\n- You should add a subtask to verify the ultimate answer. The agents should try other ways to verify the answer, e.g. using different tools.\n"

Searching can provide a broader perspective and help validate existing knowledge.  \n- If one way fails to provide an answer, try other ways or methods. The answer does exists.\n- If the search snippet is unhelpful but the URL comes from an authoritative source, try visit the website for more details.  \n- When looking for specific numerical values (e.g., dollar amounts), prioritize reliable sources and avoid relying only on search snippets.  \n- When solving tasks that require web searches, check Wikipedia first before exploring other websites.  \n- You can also simulate browser actions to get more information or verify the information you have found.\n- Browser simulation is also helpful for finding target URLs. Browser simulation operations do not necessarily need to find specific answers, but can also help find web page URLs that contain answers (usually difficult to find through simple web searches). You can find the answer to the question by performing subsequent operations on the URL, such as extracting the content of the webpage.\n- Do not solely rely on document tools or browser simulation to find the answer, you should combine document tools and browser simulation to comprehensively process web page information. Some content may need to do browser simulation to get, or some content is rendered by javascript.\n- In your response, you should mention the urls you have visited and processed.\n\nHere are some tips that help you perform web search:\n- Never add too many keywords in your search query! Some detailed results need to perform browser interaction to get, not using search toolkit.\n- If the question is complex, search results typically do not provide precise answers.

The answer does exists.\n- If the search snippet is unhelpful but the URL comes from an authoritative source, try visit the website for more details.  \n- When looking for specific numerical values (e.g., dollar amounts), prioritize reliable sources and avoid relying only on search snippets.  \n- When solving tasks that require web searches, check Wikipedia first before exploring other websites.  \n- You can also simulate browser actions to get more information or verify the information you have found.\n- Browser simulation is also helpful for finding target URLs. Browser simulation operations do not necessarily need to find specific answers, but can also help find web page URLs that contain answers (usually difficult to find through simple web searches). You can find the answer to the question by performing subsequent operations on the URL, such as extracting the content of the webpage.\n- Do not solely rely on document tools or browser simulation to find the answer, you should combine document tools and browser simulation to comprehensively process web page information. Some content may need to do browser simulation to get, or some content is rendered by javascript.\n- In your response, you should mention the urls you have visited and processed.\n\nHere are some tips that help you perform web search:\n- Never add too many keywords in your search query! Some detailed results need to perform browser interaction to get, not using search toolkit.\n- If the question is complex, search results typically do not provide precise answers. It is not likely to find the answer directly using search toolkit only, the search query should be concise and focuses on finding official sources rather than direct answers.\n  For example, as for the question \"What is the maximum length in meters of #9 in the first National Geographic short on YouTube that was ever released according to the Monterey Bay Aquarium website?\", your first search term must be coarse-grained like \"National Geographic YouTube\" to find the youtube website first, and then try other fine-grained search terms step-by-step to find more urls.\n- The results you return do not have to directly answer the original question, you only need to collect relevant information.\n"

Searching can provide a broader perspective and help validate existing knowledge.  \n- If one way fails to provide an answer, try other ways or methods. The answer does exists.\n- If the search snippet is unhelpful but the URL comes from an authoritative source, try visit the website for more details.  \n- When looking for specific numerical values (e.g., dollar amounts), prioritize reliable sources and avoid relying only on search snippets.  \n- When solving tasks that require web searches, check Wikipedia first before exploring other websites.  \n- You can also simulate browser actions to get more information or verify the information you have found.\n- Browser simulation is also helpful for finding target URLs. Browser simulation operations do not necessarily need to find specific answers, but can also help find web page URLs that contain answers (usually difficult to find through simple web searches). You can find the answer to the question by performing subsequent operations on the URL, such as extracting the content of the webpage.\n- Do not solely rely on document tools or browser simulation to find the answer, you should combine document tools and browser simulation to comprehensively process web page information. Some content may need to do browser simulation to get, or some content is rendered by javascript.\n- In your response, you should mention the urls you have visited and processed.\n\nHere are some tips that help you perform web search:\n- Never add too many keywords in your search query! Some detailed results need to perform browser interaction to get, not using search toolkit.\n- If the question is complex, search results typically do not provide precise answers. It is not likely to find the answer directly using search toolkit only, the search query should be concise and focuses on finding official sources rather than direct answers.\n  For example, as for the question \"What is the maximum length in meters of #9 in the first National Geographic short on YouTube that was ever released according to the Monterey Bay Aquarium website?\", your first search term must be coarse-grained like \"National Geographic YouTube\" to find the youtube website first, and then try other fine-grained search terms step-by-step to find more urls.\n- The results you return do not have to directly answer the original question, you only need to collect relevant information.\n"

Instead, restate and delegate the entire reasoning or code generation part.\nWhen a task involves knowledge-based content (such as formulas, constants, or factual information), agents must use the search tool to retrieve up-to-date and authoritative sources for verification. Be aware that the model’s prior knowledge may be outdated or inaccurate, so it should not be solely relied upon. Your decomposition of subtasks must explicitly reflect this, i.e. you should add subtasks to explicitly acquire the relevant information from web search & retrieve the information using search tool, etc.\n\nWhen performing a task, you need to determine whether it should be completed using code execution instead of step-by-step tool interactions. Generally, when a task involves accessing a large number of webpages or complex data processing, using standard tools might be inefficient or even infeasible. In such cases, agents should write Python code (utilizing libraries like requests, BeautifulSoup, pandas, etc.) to automate the process. Here are some scenarios where using code is the preferred approach:\n1. Tasks requiring access to a large number of webpages. Example: \"How many times was a Twitter/X post cited as a reference on English Wikipedia pages for each day of August in the last June 2023 versions of the pages?\" Reason: Manually checking each Wikipedia page would be highly inefficient, while Python code can systematically fetch and process the required data.\n2. Data processing involving complex filtering or calculations. Example: \"Analyze all article titles on Hacker News in March 2024 and find the top 10 most frequently occurring keywords.\" Reason: This task requires processing a large amount of text data, which is best handled programmatically.\n3. Cross-referencing information from multiple data sources. Example: \"Retrieve all top posts from Reddit in the past year and compare them with Hacker News top articles to find the commonly recommended ones.\" Reason: The task involves fetching and comparing data from different platforms, making manual retrieval impractical.\n4. Repetitive query tasks. Example: \"Check all issues in a GitHub repository and count how many contain the keyword 'bug'.\" Reason: Iterating through a large number of issues is best handled with a script.\nIf the task needs writing code, do not forget to remind the agent to execute the written code, and report the result after executing the code.\n\nHere are some additional tips for you:\n- Though it's not a must, you should try your best effort to make each subtask achievable for a worker.\n- You don't need to explicitly mention what tools to use and what workers to use in the subtasks, just let the agent decide what to do.\n- Your decomposed subtasks should be clear and concrete, without any ambiguity.\n- There are some intermediate steps that cannot be answered in one step. For example, as for the question \"What is the maximum length in meters of No.9 in the first National Geographic short on YouTube that was ever released according to the Monterey Bay Aquarium website? Just give the number.\", It is impossible to directly find \"No.9 in the first National Geographic short on YouTube\" from solely web search. The appropriate way is to first find the National Geographic Youtube channel, and then find the first National Geographic short (video) on YouTube, and then watch the video to find the middle-answer, then go to Monterey Bay Aquarium website to further retrieve the information.\n- If the task mentions some sources (e.g. youtube, girls who code, nature, etc.), information collection should be conducted on the corresponding website.\n"

Searching can provide a broader perspective and help validate existing knowledge.  \n- If one way fails to provide an answer, try other ways or methods. The answer does exists.\n- If the search snippet is unhelpful but the URL comes from an authoritative source, try visit the website for more details.  \n- When looking for specific numerical values (e.g., dollar amounts), prioritize reliable sources and avoid relying only on search snippets.  \n- When solving tasks that require web searches, check Wikipedia first before exploring other websites.  \n- You can also simulate browser actions to get more information or verify the information you have found.\n- Browser simulation is also helpful for finding target URLs. Browser simulation operations do not necessarily need to find specific answers, but can also help find web page URLs that contain answers (usually difficult to find through simple web searches). You can find the answer to the question by performing subsequent operations on the URL, such as extracting the content of the webpage.\n- Do not solely rely on document tools or browser simulation to find the answer, you should combine document tools and browser simulation to comprehensively process web page information. Some content may need to do browser simulation to get, or some content is rendered by javascript.\n- In your response, you should mention the urls you have visited and processed.\n\nHere are some tips that help you perform web search:\n- Never add too many keywords in your search query! Some detailed results need to perform browser interaction to get, not using search toolkit.\n- If the question is complex, search results typically do not provide precise answers. It is not likely to find the answer directly using search toolkit only, the search query should be concise and focuses on finding official sources rather than direct answers.\n  For example, as for the question \"What is the maximum length in meters of #9 in the first National Geographic short on YouTube that was ever released according to the Monterey Bay Aquarium website?\", your first search term must be coarse-grained like \"National Geographic YouTube\" to find the youtube website first, and then try other fine-grained search terms step-by-step to find more urls.\n- The results you return do not have to directly answer the original question, you only need to collect relevant information.\n"

The group also operates The Oberoi Centre of Learning and Development, which is regarded as one of Asia's top institutions for hospitality education.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nThe foundations of The Oberoi Group date back to 1934 when Rai Bahadur Mohan Singh Oberoi, the founder of the group, bought two properties: the Maidens in Delhi and the Clarkes in Shimla.\\nIn the following years Oberoi, assisted by his two sons, Tilak Raj Singh Oberoi and Prithvi Raj Singh Oberoi, continued the expansion of their group with properties both in India and abroad.\\n\\n\\n=== November 2008 terrorist attack ===\\n\\nOn 26 November 2008, Trident Mumbai was attacked by 2 terrorists, Fahadullah and Abdul Rehman of Lashkar-e-Taiba  organization as a part of the 2008 Mumbai attacks. 32 staff and guests were killed during the three-day siege.\\n\\n\\n== Ownership ==\\n\\nThe two major holding companies of The Oberoi Group are EIH Ltd and EIH Associated Hotels (formerly East India Hotels). Arjun Singh Oberoi is the current chairman of The Oberoi Group, his brother, Vikramjit Singh Oberoi at the holding companies.\\nThe Oberoi family is the majority shareholder in EIH Ltd with a 32.11% stake. Conglomerate ITC Limited owns approximately a 14.98% stake in EIH Ltd. To ward off pressures from ITC Ltd. whose ownership stands precariously close to the automatic open offer trigger at 15%, the Oberoi family divested a 14.12% stake in EIH Ltd. to Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Investment and Holding Pvt Ltd. The stake sale happened on 30 August 2010 for ₹10.21 billion (equivalent to ₹23 billion or US$270 million in 2023) valuing EIH Ltd. at an enterprise value of ₹72 billion (equivalent to ₹160 billion or US$1.9 billion in 2023). Recently the stake of Reliance further raised from ITC and it stood at 20% overall for Reliance Industries.\\n\\n\\n== Properties ==\\nThe company currently manages 32 hotels under the luxury brand Oberoi Hotels & Resorts, with a further 10 five-star properties under the Trident Hotels brand. The group also operates the Clarkes Hotel in Shimla and the Maidens Hotel, Delhi. However, these two properties are not held under the Trident or under the Oberoi brand. The Clarkes Hotel, after remaining temporarily shut following its lawns caving in because of construction in the eco-sensitive vicinity, reopened on 16 September 2012.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nTaj Hotels\\nThe Postcard Hotel\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n Media related to Oberoi Hotels & Resorts at Wikimedia Commons\\n\\nOfficial website\"}",

The group also operates The Oberoi Centre of Learning and Development, which is regarded as one of Asia's top institutions for hospitality education.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nThe foundations of The Oberoi Group date back to 1934 when Rai Bahadur Mohan Singh Oberoi, the founder of the group, bought two properties: the Maidens in Delhi and the Clarkes in Shimla.\\nIn the following years Oberoi, assisted by his two sons, Tilak Raj Singh Oberoi and Prithvi Raj Singh Oberoi, continued the expansion of their group with properties both in India and abroad.\\n\\n\\n=== November 2008 terrorist attack ===\\n\\nOn 26 November 2008, Trident Mumbai was attacked by 2 terrorists, Fahadullah and Abdul Rehman of Lashkar-e-Taiba  organization as a part of the 2008 Mumbai attacks. 32 staff and guests were killed during the three-day siege.\\n\\n\\n== Ownership ==\\n\\nThe two major holding companies of The Oberoi Group are EIH Ltd and EIH Associated Hotels (formerly East India Hotels). Arjun Singh Oberoi is the current chairman of The Oberoi Group, his brother, Vikramjit Singh Oberoi at the holding companies.\\nThe Oberoi family is the majority shareholder in EIH Ltd with a 32.11% stake. Conglomerate ITC Limited owns approximately a 14.98% stake in EIH Ltd. To ward off pressures from ITC Ltd. whose ownership stands precariously close to the automatic open offer trigger at 15%, the Oberoi family divested a 14.12% stake in EIH Ltd. to Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Investment and Holding Pvt Ltd. The stake sale happened on 30 August 2010 for ₹10.21 billion (equivalent to ₹23 billion or US$270 million in 2023) valuing EIH Ltd. at an enterprise value of ₹72 billion (equivalent to ₹160 billion or US$1.9 billion in 2023). Recently the stake of Reliance further raised from ITC and it stood at 20% overall for Reliance Industries.\\n\\n\\n== Properties ==\\nThe company currently manages 32 hotels under the luxury brand Oberoi Hotels & Resorts, with a further 10 five-star properties under the Trident Hotels brand. The group also operates the Clarkes Hotel in Shimla and the Maidens Hotel, Delhi. However, these two properties are not held under the Trident or under the Oberoi brand. The Clarkes Hotel, after remaining temporarily shut following its lawns caving in because of construction in the eco-sensitive vicinity, reopened on 16 September 2012.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nTaj Hotels\\nThe Postcard Hotel\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n Media related to Oberoi Hotels & Resorts at Wikimedia Commons\\n\\nOfficial website\"}",

Searching can provide a broader perspective and help validate existing knowledge.  \n- If one way fails to provide an answer, try other ways or methods. The answer does exists.\n- If the search snippet is unhelpful but the URL comes from an authoritative source, try visit the website for more details.  \n- When looking for specific numerical values (e.g., dollar amounts), prioritize reliable sources and avoid relying only on search snippets.  \n- When solving tasks that require web searches, check Wikipedia first before exploring other websites.  \n- You can also simulate browser actions to get more information or verify the information you have found.\n- Browser simulation is also helpful for finding target URLs. Browser simulation operations do not necessarily need to find specific answers, but can also help find web page URLs that contain answers (usually difficult to find through simple web searches). You can find the answer to the question by performing subsequent operations on the URL, such as extracting the content of the webpage.\n- Do not solely rely on document tools or browser simulation to find the answer, you should combine document tools and browser simulation to comprehensively process web page information. Some content may need to do browser simulation to get, or some content is rendered by javascript.\n- In your response, you should mention the urls you have visited and processed.\n\nHere are some tips that help you perform web search:\n- Never add too many keywords in your search query! Some detailed results need to perform browser interaction to get, not using search toolkit.\n- If the question is complex, search results typically do not provide precise answers. It is not likely to find the answer directly using search toolkit only, the search query should be concise and focuses on finding official sources rather than direct answers.\n  For example, as for the question \"What is the maximum length in meters of #9 in the first National Geographic short on YouTube that was ever released according to the Monterey Bay Aquarium website?\", your first search term must be coarse-grained like \"National Geographic YouTube\" to find the youtube website first, and then try other fine-grained search terms step-by-step to find more urls.\n- The results you return do not have to directly answer the original question, you only need to collect relevant information.\n"

Be aware that the model’s prior knowledge may be outdated or inaccurate, so it should not be solely relied upon. Your decomposition of subtasks must explicitly reflect this, i.e. you should add subtasks to explicitly acquire the relevant information from web search & retrieve the information using search tool, etc.\n\nWhen performing a task, you need to determine whether it should be completed using code execution instead of step-by-step tool interactions. Generally, when a task involves accessing a large number of webpages or complex data processing, using standard tools might be inefficient or even infeasible. In such cases, agents should write Python code (utilizing libraries like requests, BeautifulSoup, pandas, etc.) to automate the process. Here are some scenarios where using code is the preferred approach:\n1. Tasks requiring access to a large number of webpages. Example: \"How many times was a Twitter/X post cited as a reference on English Wikipedia pages for each day of August in the last June 2023 versions of the pages?\" Reason: Manually checking each Wikipedia page would be highly inefficient, while Python code can systematically fetch and process the required data.\n2. Data processing involving complex filtering or calculations. Example: \"Analyze all article titles on Hacker News in March 2024 and find the top 10 most frequently occurring keywords.\" Reason: This task requires processing a large amount of text data, which is best handled programmatically.\n3. Cross-referencing information from multiple data sources. Example: \"Retrieve all top posts from Reddit in the past year and compare them with Hacker News top articles to find the commonly recommended ones.\" Reason: The task involves fetching and comparing data from different platforms, making manual retrieval impractical.\n4. Repetitive query tasks. Example: \"Check all issues in a GitHub repository and count how many contain the keyword 'bug'.\" Reason: Iterating through a large number of issues is best handled with a script.\nIf the task needs writing code, do not forget to remind the agent to execute the written code, and report the result after executing the code.\n\nHere are some additional tips for you:\n- Though it's not a must, you should try your best effort to make each subtask achievable for a worker.\n- You don't need to explicitly mention what tools to use and what workers to use in the subtasks, just let the agent decide what to do.\n- Your decomposed subtasks should be clear and concrete, without any ambiguity. The subtasks should always be consistent with the overall task.\n- You need to flexibly adjust the number of subtasks according to the steps of the overall task. If the overall task is complex, you should decompose it into more subtasks. Otherwise, you should decompose it into less subtasks (e.g. 2-3 subtasks).\n- There are some intermediate steps that cannot be answered in one step. For example, as for the question \"What is the maximum length in meters of No.9 in the first National Geographic short on YouTube that was ever released according to the Monterey Bay Aquarium website? Just give the number.\", It is impossible to directly find \"No.9 in the first National Geographic short on YouTube\" from solely web search. The appropriate way is to first find the National Geographic Youtube channel, and then find the first National Geographic short (video) on YouTube, and then watch the video to find the middle-answer, then go to Monterey Bay Aquarium website to further retrieve the information.\n- If the task mentions some sources (e.g. youtube, girls who code, nature, etc.), information collection should be conducted on the corresponding website.\n- You should add a subtask to verify the ultimate answer. The agents should try other ways to verify the answer, e.g. using different tools.\n"
